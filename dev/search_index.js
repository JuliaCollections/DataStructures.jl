Most behavior is similar to a normal IntSet, however collect, first and last are with respected to the packed vector, in which the ordering is not guaranteed. The reverse Vector is paged, meaning that it is a Vector{Vector{Int}} where each of the Vector{Int}s has the length of one memory page of Ints.
