A DefaultOrderedDict does the same for an OrderedDict.\n\nConstructors:\n\nDefaultDict(default, kv)    # create a DefaultDict with a default value or function,\n                            # optionally wrapping an existing dictionary\n                            # or array of key-value pairs\n\nDefaultDict{KeyType, ValueType}(default)   # create a DefaultDict with Dict type (KeyType,ValueType)\n\nDefaultOrderedDict(default, kv)     # create a DefaultOrderedDict with a default value or function,\n                                    # optionally wrapping an existing dictionary\n                                    # or array of key-value pairs\n\nDefaultOrderedDict{KeyType, ValueType}(default) # create a DefaultOrderedDict with Dict type (KeyType,ValueType)\n\nAll constructors also take a passkey::Bool=false keyword argument which determines whether to pass along the key argument when calling the default function. It has no effect when the key is just a value.\n\nExamples using DefaultDict:\n\ndd = DefaultDict(1)               # create an (Any=>Any) DefaultDict with a default value of 1\n\ndd = DefaultDict{AbstractString, Int}(0)  # create a (AbstractString=>Int) DefaultDict with a default value of 0\n\nd = Dict('a'=>1, 'b'=>2)\ndd = DefaultDict(0, d)            # provide a default value to an existing dictionary\nd['c']  # should raise a KeyError because 'c' key doesn't exist\ndd['c']\n\ndd = DefaultOrderedDict(time)     # call time() to provide the default value for an OrderedDict\ndd = DefaultDict(Dict)            # Create a dictionary of dictionaries - Dict() is called to provide the default value\ndd = DefaultDict(()->myfunc())    # call function myfunc to provide the default value\n\nThese all create the same default dict\n\ndd = DefaultDict{AbstractString, Vector{Int}}(() -> Vector{Int}())\n\ndd = DefaultDict{AbstractString, Vector{Int}}(() -> Int[])\n\ndd = DefaultDict{AbstractString, Vector{Int}}(Vector{Int})\n\npush!(dd[\"A\"], 1)\n\npush!(dd[\"B\"], 2)\n\ndd\n\nCreate a Dictionary of type AbstractString=>DefaultDict{AbstractString, Int}, where the default of the inner set of DefaultDicts is zero\n\ndd = DefaultDict{AbstractString, DefaultDict}(() -> DefaultDict{AbstractString,Int}(0))\n\nUse DefaultDict to cache an expensive function call, i.e., memoize\n\ndd = DefaultDict{AbstractString, Int}(passkey=true) do key\n    len = length(key)\n    sleep(len)\n    return len\nend\n\ndd[\"hi\"]  # slow\n\ndd[\"ho\"]  # slow\n\ndd[\"hi\"]  # fast\n\nNote that in the second-last example, we need to use a function to create each new DefaultDict.

SortedDict is similar to the built-in Julia type Dict with the additional feature that the keys are stored in sorted order and can be efficiently iterated in this order. SortedDict is a subtype of AbstractDict. It is generally slower than Dict because looking up a key requires an O(log n) tree search rather than an expected O(1) hash-table lookup time of Dict. SortedDict is a parameterized type with three parameters, the key type K, the value type V, and the ordering type O. SortedSet has only keys; it is an alternative to the built-in Set container and is a subtype of AbstractSet. Internally, SortedSet is implemented as a SortedDict in which the value type is Nothing. Finally, SortedMultiDict is similar to SortedDict except that each key can be associated with multiple values. The key=>value pairs in a SortedMultiDict are stored according to the sorted order for keys, and key=>value pairs with the same key are stored in order of insertion.\n\nThe containers internally use a 2-3 tree, which is a kind of balanced tree and is described in data structure textbooks.  Internally, one Vector is used to store key/data pairs (the leaves of the tree) while a second holds the tree structure.\n\nThe containers require two functions to compare keys: a less-than and equals function. With the default ordering argument, the comparison functions are isless(key1,key2) (true when key1 < key2) and isequal(key1,key2) (true when key1 == key2) where key1 and key2 are keys. More details are provided below.","category":"section"},{"location":"sorted_containers/#Tokens-for-Sorted-Containers","page":"Sorted Containers","title":"Tokens for Sorted Containers","text":"The sorted containers support an object for indexing called a token defined as a two-entry tuple and aliased as SortedDictToken, SortedMultiDictToken, or SortedSetToken. A token is the address of a single data item in the container and can be dereferenced in time O(1).\n\nThe first entry of a token tuple is the container as a whole, and the second refers to the particular item. The second part is called a semitoken. The type of the semitoken is IntSemiToken.\n\nA restriction for the sorted containers is that IntSemiToken cannot used as the key-type. This is because ambiguity would result between the two subscripting calls sc[k] and sc[st] described below. In the rare scenario that a sorted container whose key-type is IntSemiToken is required, a workaround is to wrap the key inside another immutable structure.\n\nThe notion of token is similar to the concept of iterators used by C++ standard containers. Tokens can be explicitly advanced or regressed through the data in the sorted order; they are implicitly advanced or regressed via iteration defined below.\n\nA token may take two special values: the before-start value and the past-end value. These values act as lower and upper bounds on the actual data. The before-start token can be advanced, while the past-end token can be regressed. A dereferencing operation on either leads to an error.\n\nIn the current implementation, semitokens are internally stored as integers. Users should regard these integers as opaque since future versions of the package may change the internal indexing scheme. In certain situations it may be more costly to operate on tokens than semitokens because the first entry of a token (i.e., the container) is not a bits-type. If code profiling indicates that statements using tokens are allocating memory, then it may be advisable to rewrite the application code using semitokens rather than tokens.","category":"section"},{"location":"sorted_containers/#Complexity-of-Sorted-Containers","page":"Sorted Containers","title":"Complexity of Sorted Containers","text":"In the list of functions below, the running time of the various operations is provided.

If the default ordering is used, it is a requirement of the container that isequal(a,b) is true if and only if !isless(a,b) and !isless(b,a) are both true. This relationship between isequal and isless holds for common built-in types, but it may not hold for all types, especially user-defined types. If it does not hold for a certain type, then a custom ordering argument must be defined as discussed in the next few paragraphs.\n\nThe name for the default ordering (i.e., using isless and isequal) is Forward. Note: this is the name of the ordering object; its type is ForwardOrdering. Another possible ordering object is Reverse, which reverses the usual sorted order. This name must be imported import Base.Reverse if it is used.\n\nAs an example of a custom ordering, suppose the keys are of type String, and the user wishes to order the keys ignoring case: APPLE, berry and Cherry would appear in that order, and APPLE and aPPlE would be indistinguishable in this ordering.\n\nThe simplest approach is to define an ordering object of the form Lt(my_isless), where Lt is a built-in type (see ordering.jl) and my_isless is the user's comparison function. In the above example, the ordering object would be:\n\nLt((x,y) -> isless(lowercase(x),lowercase(y)))\n\nThe ordering object is indicated in the above list of constructors in the o position (see above for constructor syntax).\n\nThis approach may suffer from a performance hit because higher performance may be possible if an equality method is also available as well as a less-than method. A more complicated but higher-performance method to implement a custom ordering is as follows. First, the user creates a singleton type that is a subtype of Ordering as follows:\n\nstruct CaseInsensitive <: Ordering\nend\n\nNext, the user defines a method named lt for less-than in this ordering:\n\nlt(::CaseInsensitive, a, b) = isless(lowercase(a), lowercase(b))\n\nThe first argument to lt is an object of the CaseInsensitive type (there is only one such object since it is a singleton type). The container also needs an equal-to function; the default is:\n\neq(o::Ordering, a, b) = !lt(o, a, b) && !lt(o, b, a)\n\nThe user can also customize this function with a more efficient implementation. In the above example, an appropriate customization would be:\n\neq(::CaseInsensitive, a, b) = isequal(lowercase(a), lowercase(b))\n\nNote: the user-defined eq and lt functions must be compatible in the sense that !lt(o, a, b) && !lt(o, b, a) if and only if  eq(o, a, b).\n\nFinally, the user specifies the unique element of CaseInsensitive, namely the object CaseInsensitive(), as the ordering object to the SortedDict, SortedMultiDict or SortedSet constructor.\n\nFor the above code to work, the module must make the following declarations, typically near the beginning:\n\nimport Base.Ordering\nimport Base.lt\nimport DataStructures.eq","category":"section"},{"location":"sorted_containers/#Cautionary-note-on-mutable-keys","page":"Sorted Containers","title":"Cautionary note on mutable keys","text":"As with ordinary Dicts, keys for the sorted containers can be either mutable or immutable.

The keys, values, or pairs modifiers described above  are ignored.\n\nFinally, a tkv iteration can be reversed by the Iterators.reverse function.  The Iterators.reverse function may be nested in an arbitrary position with respect to the other operations described  above. Two reverse operations cancel each other out.  For example, Iterators.reverse(keys(Iterators.reverse(m))) is the same iteration as keys(m).\n\nFor compatibility with Base, there is also an eachindex function: eachindex(b) where the base object b a SortedDict is the same as keys(b) (to be compatible with Dict).   On the other hand, eachindex(b) where the base object b is a SortedSet or SortedMultiDict is the same as onlysemitokens(b).\n\nColon notation a:b  is equivalent to onlytokens(inclusive(a[1], a[2], b[2])), in other words, it yields an iteration that provides all the tokens of items in the sort order ranging from token a up to token b. It is required that a[1]===b[1] (i.e., a and b are tokens for the same container).  Exclusive iteration using colon notation is obtained via a : b-1.\n\nExamples:\n\n   for (k,v) in sd\n       <body>\n   end\n\nHere, sd is a SortedDict or SortedMultiDict.  The variables (k,v)  are set to consecutive key-value pairs.  All items in the container are produced in order.\n\n   for k in inclusive(ss, st1, st2)\n       <body>\n   end\n\nHere, ss is a SortedSet, and st1, and st2 are semitokens indexing ss.

In this case, t will be tokens of consecutive items, while k will be the corresponding keys.  The returned keys lie between key1 and key2 excluding key2.\n\n   for (t,k) in Iterators.reverse(tokens(keys(exclusive_key(sd, key1, key2))))\n      <body>\n   end\n\nSame as above, except the iteration is in the reverse order.\n\nWriting on the objects returned by values is not currently supported, e.g., the following map! statement is not implemented even though the  analogous statement is available for Dict in Base.\n\n    s = SortedDict(3=>4)\n    map!(x -> x*2, values(s))\n\nThe workaround is an explicit loop:\n\n    s = SortedDict(3=>4)\n    for t in onlysemitokens(s)\n        s[t] *= 2\n    end\n\nRunning time for all iterations: O(c(s + log n)), where s is the number of steps from start to end of the iteration.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"sorted_containers/#Base.in-Tuple{Any, SortedSet}","page":"Sorted Containers","title":"Base.in","text":"Base.in(k,m::SortedSet)\n\nReturn true iff element k is in sorted set m is a sorted set.
