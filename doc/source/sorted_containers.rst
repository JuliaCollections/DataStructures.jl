Overview of Sorted Containers
----------------------------------------

Three sorted containers are provided:
SortedDict, SortedMultiDict and SortedSet.
*SortedDict* is similar to the built-in Julia type ``Dict``
with the additional feature that the keys are stored in
sorted order and can be efficiently iterated in this order.
SortedDict is a subtype of Associative.  It is slower than ``Dict``
because looking up a key requires an O(log *n*) tree search rather than
an expected O(1) hash-table lookup time as with Dict.
SortedDict is
a parametrized type with three parameters, the key type ``K``, the
value type ``V``, and the ordering type ``O``.
SortedSet has
only keys; it is an alternative to the built-in
``Set`` container.  Internally,
SortedSet is implemented as a SortedDict in which the value type
is ``Void``.
Finally, SortedMultiDict is similar to SortedDict except that each key
can be associated with multiple values.  The key=>value pairs in
a SortedMultiDict are stored according to the sorted order for keys,
and key=>value pairs with the same
key are stored in order of insertion.

The containers internally use a 2-3 tree, which is a
kind of balanced tree and is described in many elementary data
structure textbooks.

The containers require two functions to compare keys: a *less-than* and
*equals* function.  With the
default ordering argument, the comparison
functions are ``isless(key1,key2)`` (true when ``key1 < key2``)
and ``isequal(key1,key2)`` (true when ``key1 == key2``) where ``key1`` and ``key2``
are keys.
More details are provided below.

------------------------------
Tokens for Sorted Containers
------------------------------

The sorted container objects use a special type for indexing
called a *token*
defined as a two-entry tuple and aliased as
``SDToken``, ``SMDToken``, and ``SetToken`` for SortedDict, SortedMultiDict
and SortedSet respectively.
A token is the
address of a single data item in the container and can be
dereferenced in time O(1).

The first entry of a Token tuple is the container as a whole, and the
second refers to the particular item.  The second part is called a
*semitoken*.  The types for a semitoken are ``SDSemiToken``, ``SMDSemiToken``,
and ``SetSemiToken`` for the three types of containers SortedDict, SortedMultiDict
and SortedSet.  These types are
all aliases of ``IntSemiToken``.

A restriction for the sorted containers is that
``IntSemiToken`` or its aliases cannot used as the key-type.
This is because
ambiguity would result between the
two subscripting calls ``sc[k]`` and ``sc[st]`` described below.  In the
rare scenario that a sorted container whose key-type is ``IntSemiToken``
is required,
a workaround is to wrap the key inside another immutable
structure.

In the current
version of Julia, it is costly to operate on tuples whose entries are not bits-types
because such tuples are allocated on the heap.
For example, the first entry of a token is a pointer to a container
(a non-bits type), so
a new token is allocated on the heap rather than the
stack.  In order to avoid performance loss, the package uses tokens
less frequently than semitokens.  For a function
taking a token as an argument like
``deref`` described below, if it is invoked by explicitly naming
the token like this::

    tok = (sc,st)   # sc is a sorted container, st is a semitoken
    k,v = deref(tok)

then there may be a loss of performance
compared to::

    k,v = deref((sc,st))

because the former needs an extra heap allocation step for ``tok``.


The notion of token is similar to the concept of iterators used
by C++ standard containers.
Tokens can be explicitly advanced or regressed through the data in
the sorted order; they are implicitly advanced or regressed via
iteration loops defined below.

A token may take two
special values:
the *before-start* value and the *past-end* value.  These
values act as lower and upper bounds
on the actual data.  The before-start token can be advanced,
while the past-end token can be regressed.  A dereferencing operation on either
leads to an error.

In the current implementation,
semitokens are internally stored as integers. However,
for the purpose of future compatibility,
the user should  not extract this internal representation;
these integers do not have a documented interpretation
in terms of the container.

----------------------------------
Constructors for Sorted Containers
----------------------------------

``SortedDict(d)``
  Argument ``d`` is an ordinary Julia dict (or any associative type)
  used to initialize the container::

     c = SortedDict(Dict("New York" => 1788, "Illinois" => 1818))


  In this example the key-type is deduced to be ASCIIString, while the
  value-type is Int.  The default ordering object ``Forward`` is used.
  See below for more information about ordering.

``SortedDict(d,o)``
  Argument ``d`` is an ordinary Julia dict (or any associative type)
  used to initialize the container and ``o`` is an ordering object
  used for ordering the keys.

``SortedDict(k1=>v1, k2=>v2, ...)``
  Arguments are key-value pairs for insertion into the
  dictionary.
  The keys must be of the same type as one another; the
  values must also be of one type.

``SortedDict(o, k1=>v1, k2=>v2, ...)``
  The first argument ``o`` is an ordering object.  The remaining
  arguments are key-value pairs for insertion into the
  dictionary.
  The keys must be of the same type as one another; the
  values must also be of one type.

``SortedDict(iter)``
  Takes an arbitrary iterable object of key=>value pairs.
  The default Forward ordering is used.

``SortedDict(iter,o)``
  Takes an arbitrary iterable object of key=>value pairs.
  The ordering object ``o`` is explicitly given.

``SortedDict{K,V,Ord}(o)``
  Construct an empty SortedDict in which type parameters
  are explicitly listed; ordering object is explicitly specified.
  (See below for discussion of ordering.)  An empty SortedDict
  may also be constructed using ``SortedDict(Dict{K,V}(),o)``
  where the ``o`` argument is optional.

``SortedMultiDict(ks,vs,o)``
  Construct a SortedMultiDict using keys given by ``ks``, values
  given by ``vs`` and ordering object ``o``.  The ordering object
  defaults to ``Forward`` if not specified.  The two arguments
  ``ks`` and ``vs`` are 1-dimensional arrays of the same length in
  which ``ks`` holds keys and ``vs`` holds the corresponding values.


``SortedMultiDict(k1=>v1, k2=>v2, ...)``
  Arguments are key-value pairs for insertion into the
  multidict.
  The keys must be of the same type as one another; the
  values must also be of one type.


``SortedMultiDict(o, k1=>v1, k2=>v2, ...)``
  The first argument ``o`` is an ordering object.  The remaining
  arguments are key-value pairs for insertion into the
  multidict.
  The keys must be of the same type as one another; the
  values must also be of one type.


``SortedMultiDict(iter)``
  Takes an arbitrary iterable object of key=>value pairs.
  The default Forward ordering is used.

``SortedMultiDict(iter,o)``
  Takes an arbitrary iterable object of key=>value pairs.
  The ordering object ``o`` is explicitly given.


``SortedMultiDict{K,V,Ord}(o)``
  Construct an empty sorted multidict in which type parameters
  are explicitly listed; ordering object is explicitly specified.
  (See below for discussion of ordering.)  An empty SortedMultiDict
  may also be constructed via ``SortedMultiDict(K[], V[], o)`` where
  the ``o`` argument is optional.

``SortedSet(iter,o)``
  Construct a SortedSet using keys given by iterable ``iter`` (e.g.,
  an array)
  and ordering object ``o``.  The ordering object
  defaults to ``Forward`` if not specified.

``SortedSet{K,Ord}(o)``
  Construct an empty sorted set in which type parameter
  is explicitly listed; ordering object is explicitly specified.
  (See below for discussion of ordering.)  An alternate way
  to create an empty set of type ``K`` is ``SortedSet(K[], o)``;
  again, the order argument defaults to ``Forward`` if not
  specified.



---------------------------------
Complexity of Sorted Containers
---------------------------------

In the list of functions below, the running time of the various
operations is provided.  In these running times,
*n* denotes the current size
(number of items) in the
container at the time of the function call, and *c* denotes the
time needed to compare two keys.

--------------------------------------
Navigating the Containers
--------------------------------------
``sd[k]``
  Argument ``sd`` is a SortedDict and ``k`` is a key.  In an
  expression, this retrieves the value associated with the key
  (or ``KeyError`` if none).  On the left-hand side of an
  assignment, this assigns or
  reassigns the value associated with the key.  (For assigning and reassigning,
  see also ``insert!`` below.)  Time: O(*c* log *n*)

``find(sd,k)``
  Argument ``sd`` is a SortedDict and argument ``k`` is a key.
  This function returns the semitoken that refers to the item whose key
  is ``k``, or
  past-end semitoken if ``k`` is absent. Time: O(*c* log *n*)

``deref((sc,st))``
  Argument ``(sc,st)``
  is a token (i.e., ``sc`` is a container and ``st`` is a semitoken).
  Note the double-parentheses in the calling syntax: the argument of ``deref``
  is  a token, which is defined to be a 2-tuple.
  This returns a key=>value pair.
  pointed to by the token for SortedDict and SortedMultiDict.
  Note that the syntax
  ``k,v=deref((sc,st))`` is valid because Julia automatically iterates
  over the two entries of the Pair in order to assign ``k`` and ``v``.
  For SortedSet this returns a key.  Time: O(1)


``deref_key((sc,st))``
  Argument ``(sc,st)`` is a token for SortedMultiDict or SortedDict.
  This returns the key (i.e., the first half of a key=>value pair)
  pointed to by the token.  This functionality is available as plain ``deref``
  for SortedSet.
  Time: O(1)


``deref_value((sc,st))``
  Argument ``(sc,st)`` is a token for SortedMultiDict or SortedDict.
  This returns the value (i.e., the second half of a key=>value pair)
  pointed to by the token.
  Time: O(1)


``startof(sc)``
  Argument ``sc`` is SortedDict, SortedMultiDict or SortedSet.  This function
  returns the semitoken of the first item according
  to the sorted order in the container.  If the container is empty,
  it returns the past-end semitoken. Time: O(log *n*)

``endof(sc)``
  Argument ``sc`` is a SortedDict, SortedMultiDict or SortedSet.  This function
  returns the semitoken of the last item according
  to the sorted order in the container.  If the container is empty,
  it returns the before-start semitoken.  Time: O(log *n*)

``first(sc)``
  Argument ``sc`` is a SortedDict, SortedMultiDict or SortedSet  This function
  returns the first item (a ``k=>v`` pair for SortedDict and SortedMultiDict or
  a key for SortedSet)
  according
  to the sorted order in the container.  Thus, ``first(sc)`` is
  equivalent to ``deref((sc,startof(sc)))``.
  It is an error to call this
  function on an empty container. Time: O(log *n*)

``last(sc)``
  Argument ``sc`` is a SortedDict, SortedMultiDict or SortedSet.  This function
  returns the last item (a ``k=>v`` pair for SortedDict and SortedMultiDict
  or   a key for SortedSet)
  according
  to the sorted order in the container.  Thus, ``last(sc)`` is
  equivalent to ``deref((sc,endof(sc)))``.
  It is an error to call this
  function on an empty container.  Time: O(log *n*)

``pastendsemitoken(sc)``
  Argument ``sc`` is a SortedDict, SortedMultiDict or SortedSet.  This
  function returns the past-end semitoken.  Time: O(1)

``beforestartsemitoken(sc)``
  Argument ``sc`` is a SortedDict, SortedMultiDict or SortedSet.  This
  function returns the before-start semitoken.  Time: O(1)

``advance((sc,st))``
  Argument   ``(sc,st)`` is a token.  This function returns the semitoken of the
  next entry in the container according to the sort order of the
  keys.  After the last item, this routine returns the past-end
  semitoken.  It is an error to invoke this function if ``(sc,st)`` is the
  past-end token.  If ``(sc,st)`` is the before-start token, then this
  routine returns the semitoken of the first item in the sort order (i.e., the
  same semitoken returned by the ``startof`` function).
  Time: O(log *n*)


``regress((sc,st))``
  Argument
  ``(sc,st)`` is a token.  This function returns the semitoken of the
  previous entry in the container according to the sort order of the
  keys.  If ``(sc,st)`` indexes the first item, this routine returns the before-start
  semitoken.  It is an error to invoke this function if ``(sc,st)`` is the
  before-start token.  If ``(sc,st)`` is the past-end token, then this
  routine returns the smitoken of the last item in the sort order (i.e., the
  same semitoken returned by the ``endof`` function).
  Time: O(log *n*)

``searchsortedfirst(sc,k)``
  Argument ``sc`` is a SortedDict, SortedMultiDict or SortedSet and
  ``k`` is a key.  This routine returns the semitoken
  of the first item in the container whose key is greater than or equal to
  ``k``.  If there is no such key, then the past-end semitoken
  is returned.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)

``searchsortedlast(sc,k)``
  Argument ``sc`` is a SortedDict, SortedMultiDict or SortedSet and
  ``k`` is a key.  This routine returns the semitoken
  of the last item in the container whose key is less than or equal to
  ``k``.  If there is no such key, then the before-start semitoken
  is returned.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)


``searchsortedafter(sc,k)``
  Argument ``sc`` is a SortedDict, SortedMultiDict or SortedSet and
  ``k`` is an element of the key type.  This routine returns the semitoken
  of the first item in the container whose key is greater than
  ``k``.  If there is no such key, then the past-end semitoken
  is returned.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)


``searchequalrange(sc,k)``
   Argument ``sc`` is a SortedMultiDict and ``k`` is an element of the
   key type.  This routine returns a pair of semitokens; the first
   of the pair is the semitoken addressing the first item in the container
   with key ``k`` and the second is the semitoken addressing the
   last item in the container with key ``k``.  If no item matches
   the given key, then the pair (past-end-semitoken, before-start-semitoken)
   is returned.
   Time: O(*c* log *n*)

--------------------------------------------
Inserting & Deleting in Sorted Containers
--------------------------------------------

``empty!(sc)``
    Argument ``sc`` is a SortedDict, SortedMultiDict or SortedSet.  This
    empties the container.  Time: O(1).

``insert!(sc,k,v)``
  Argument ``sc`` is a SortedDict or SortedMultiDict, ``k`` is a key and ``v``
  is the corresponding value.  This inserts the ``(k,v)`` pair into
  the container.  If the key is already present in a
  SortedDict or SortedSet, this overwrites
  the old value.  In the case of SortedMultiDict, no overwriting takes place
  (since SortedMultiDict allows the same key to associate with multiple values).
  In the case of SortedDict, the return
  value is a pair whose first entry is boolean and indicates whether
  the insertion was new (i.e., the key was not previously present) and
  the second entry is the semitoken of the new entry.  In the case of SortedMultiDict,
  a semitoken is returned (but no boolean).
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)

``insert!(sc,k)``
  Argument ``sc`` is a SortedSet and ``k`` is a key.
  This inserts the key into
  the container.  If the key is already present in a
  this overwrites
  the old value.  (This is not necessarily a no-op; see below for
  remarks about the customizing the sort order.)
  The return
  value is a pair whose first entry is boolean and indicates whether
  the insertion was new (i.e., the key was not previously present) and
  the second entry is the semitoken of the new entry.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)

``push!(sc,k)``
  Argument ``sc`` is a SortedSet and ``k`` is a key.
  This inserts the key into
  the container.  If the key is already present in a
  this overwrites
  the old value.  (This is not necessarily a no-op; see below for
  remarks about the customizing the sort order.)
  The return
  value is ``sc``.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)

``push!(sc, k=>v)``
  Argument ``sc`` is a SortedDict or SortedMultiDict and ``k=>v`` is a
  key-value pair.
  This inserts the key-value pair into
  the container.  If the key is already present in a
  this overwrites
  the old value.
  The return
  value is ``sc``.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)



``delete!((sc,st))``
  Argument ``(sc,st)`` is a token for a SortedDict, SortedMultiDict or SortedSet.
  This operation deletes the item addressed by ``(sc,st)``.
  It is an error to call
  this on an entry that has already been deleted or on the
  before-start or past-end tokens.  After this operation is
  complete, ``(sc,st)`` is an invalid token and cannot be used in
  any further operations.
  Time: O(log *n*)

``delete!(sc,k)``
  Argument ``sc`` is a SortedDict or SortedSet and
  ``k`` is a key.  This operation deletes the item
  whose key is ``k``.  It is a  ``KeyError``
  if ``k`` is not a key of an item in the container.
  After this operation is
  complete, any token addressing the deleted item is invalid.
  Returns ``sc``.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)


``pop!(sc,k)``
  Deletes the item with key ``k`` in SortedDict or SortedSet ``sc``
  and returns
  the value that was associated with ``k`` in the
  case of SortedDict or ``k`` itself in the case of SortedSet.
  A ``KeyError`` results
  if ``k`` is not in ``sc``.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)

``pop!(ss)``
  Deletes the item with first key in SortedSet ``ss`` and
  returns the key.  A ``BoundsError`` results if ``ss`` is empty.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)

``sc[st]``
  If ``st`` is a semitoken and ``sc`` is a SortedDict or SortedMultiDict,
  then ``sc[st]`` refers to
  the value field of the (key,value) pair that the full
  token ``(sc,st)`` refers to.  This expression may occur on either side of an
  assignment statement.
  Time: O(1)


------------------------
Token Manipulation
------------------------


``compare(sc,st1,st2)``
  Here, ``st1`` and ``st2`` are semitokens for the same container ``sc``; this
  function determines the relative positions of the data items indexed by
  ``(sc,st1)`` and ``(sc,st2)`` in the sorted order.   The
  return value is -1 if ``(sc,st1)`` precedes ``(sc,st2)``, 0
  if they are equal, and 1 if ``(sc,st1)`` succeeds ``(sc,st2)``.
  This function compares the tokens by determining their relative
  position within the tree without dereferencing them.  For
  SortedDict it is mostly
  equivalent to comparing ``deref_key((sc,st1))`` to ``deref_key((sc,st2))``
  using the ordering of the SortedDict
  except in the
  case that either ``(sc,st1)`` or ``(sc,st2)`` is the before-start or past-end token,
  in which case the ``deref`` operation will fail.  Which one is more efficient
  depends on the time-complexity of comparing two keys.
  Similarly, for SortedSet it is mostly equivalent to comparing
  ``deref((sc,st1))`` to ``deref((sc,st2))``.  For SortedMultiDict, this function
  is not equivalent to a key comparison since two items in a SortedMultiDict
  with the same key are not necessarily the same item.
  Time: O(log *n*)

``status((sc,st))``
  This function returns 0 if the token ``(sc,st)`` is invalid (e.g., refers to a
  deleted item), 1 if the token is valid and points to data, 2 if the
  token is the before-start token and 3 if it is the past-end token.
  Time: O(1)


--------------------------------
Iteration Over Sorted Containers
--------------------------------

As is standard in Julia, iteration over the containers is
implemented via calls to three functions, ``start``,
``next`` and ``done``.  It is usual practice, however, to
call these functions implicitly with a for-loop rather than
explicitly, so they are presented here in for-loop notation.
Internally, all of these iterations are implemented with semitokens
that are advanced via the ``advance`` operation.
Each iteration
of these loops requires O(log *n*) operations to advance the
semitoken.   If one loops over an entire container, then the amortized
cost of advancing the semitoken drops to O(1).

The following snippet loops over the entire container ``sc``, where
``sc`` is a SortedDict or SortedMultiDict::

  for (k,v) in sc
     < body >
  end

In this loop, ``(k,v)`` takes on successive (key,value) pairs
according to
the sort order of the key.  If one uses::

  for p in sc
     < body >
  end

where ``sc`` is a SortedDict or SortedMultiDict, then ``p`` is
a ``k=>v`` pair.

For SortedSet one uses::

  for k in ss
     < body >
  end


There are two ways to iterate over a subrange of a container.
The first is the inclusive iteration for SortedDict and SortedMultiDict::

  for (k,v) in inclusive(sc,st1,st2)
    < body >
  end

Here, ``st1`` and ``st2`` are semitokens that refer to the container ``sc``.
It is acceptable for ``(sc,st1)`` to be the past-end token
or ``(sc,st2)`` to be the before-start token (in these cases, the body
is not executed).
If ``compare(sc,st1,st2)==1`` then the body is not executed.
A second calling format for ``inclusive`` is
``inclusive(sc,(st1,st2))``.  One purpose for second format is so that
the return value of ``searchequalrange`` may be used directly
as the second argument to ``inclusive``.


One can also define a loop that excludes the final item::

  for (k,v) in exclusive(sc,st1,st2)
    < body >
  end

In this case, all the data addressed by tokens from ``(sc,st1)`` up to but excluding
``(sc,st2)`` are executed.  The body is not executed at all if ``compare(sc,st1,st2)>=0``.
In this setting, either or both can be the past-end token, and ``(sc,st2)`` can
be the before-start token. For the sake
of consistency, ``exclusive`` also supports the calling format
``exclusive(sc,(st1,st2))``.  In the previous few snippets, if the loop
object is ``p`` instead of ``(k,v)``, then ``p`` is a ``k=>v`` pair.


Both the ``inclusive`` and ``exclusive`` functions return objects that can be
saved and used later for iteration.
The validity of the tokens is not checked until the loop initiates.

For SortedSet the usage is::

  for k in inclusive(ss,st1,st2)
    < body >
  end

  for k in exclusive(ss,st1,st2)
    < body >
  end


If ``sc`` is a SortedDict or SortedMultiDict,
one can iterate over just keys or just values::

   for k in keys(sc)
      < body >
   end

   for v in values(sc)
      < body >
   end

Finally, one can retrieve
semitokens during any of these iterations.  In the case
of SortedDict and SortedMultiDict, one uses::

   for (st,k,v) in semitokens(sc)
       < body >
   end

   for (st,k) in semitokens(keys(sc))
       < body >
   end

   for (st,v) in semitokens(values(sc))
       < body >
   end

In each of the above three iterations, ``st`` is a
semitoken referring to the
current ``(k,v)`` pair.
In the case of SortedSet, the following iteration may be used::

   for (st,k) in semitokens(ss)
       < body >
   end

If one wishes to retrieve only semitokens, the following may be used::

   for st in onlysemitokens(sc)
       < body >
   end


In this case, ``sc`` is a SortedDict, SortedMultiDict, or SortedSet.
To be compatible with standard containers, the package also offers
``eachindex`` iteration::


   for ind in eachindex(sc)
       < body >
   end

This iteration function ``eachindex`` is equivalent to ``keys`` in the case
of SortedDict.  It is equivalent to ``onlysemitokens`` in the case of SortedMultiDict
and SortedMultiSet.


In place of ``sc`` in the above ``keys``, ``values`` and
``semitokens``, snippets,
one could also use ``inclusive(sc,st1,st2)`` or ``exclusive(sc,st1,st2)``.
Similarly, for SortedSet, one can iterate over
``semitokens(inclusive(ss,st1,st2))`` or ``semitokens(exclusive(ss,st1,st2))``

Note that it is acceptable for the loop body in the above
``semitokens``  code snippets to invoke
``delete!((sc,st))`` or ``delete!((ss,st))``.
This is because the for-loop internal state variable
is already advanced to the next token at the beginning of the body, so
``st`` is not necessarily referred to in the loop body (unless the
user refers to it).

----------------
Other Functions
----------------

``isempty(sc)``
  Returns ``true`` if the container is empty (no items).
  Time: O(1)

``length(sc)``
  Returns the length, i.e., number of items, in the container.
  Time: O(1)

``in(p,sc)``
  Returns true if ``p`` is in ``sc``.  In the
  case that ``sc`` is a SortedDict or SortedMultiDict,
  ``p`` is a key=>value
  pair.  In the case that ``sc``
  is a SortedSet, ``p`` should be a key.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*) for SortedDict and SortedSet.
  In the case of SortedMultiDict, the time is
  O(*cl* log *n*), where *l* stands for the number
  of entries that have the key of the given pair.
  (So therefore this call is inefficient if the same key
  addresses a large number of values, and an alternative
  should be considered.)

``in(x,iter)``
  Returns true if ``x`` is in ``iter``, where
  ``iter`` refers to any of the iterable objects described
  above in the discussion of container loops and ``x``
  is of the appropriate type.
  For all of the iterables except the five listed below,
  the algorithm used
  is a linear-time search.  For example, the call::

    (k=>v) in exclusive(sd,st1,st2)

  where ``sd`` is a SortedDict, ``st1`` and ``st2`` are
  semitokens, ``k`` is a key, and ``v`` is a value, will
  loop over all entries in the dictionary between
  the two tokens and a compare for equality using ``isequal`` between the
  indexed item and ``k=>v``.

  The five exceptions are::

       (k=>v) in sd
       (k=>v) in smd
       k in ss
       k in keys(sd)
       k in keys(smd)

  Here, ``sd`` is a SortedDict,
  ``smd`` is a SortedMultiDict, and ``ss`` is a SortedSet.

  These five invocations of ``in``
  use the index structure
  of the sorted container and test equality
  based on the order object of the keys rather than ``isequal``.
  Therefore, these five are all faster than linear-time looping.
  The first three were already discussed in the previous entry.
  The last two are equivalent to ``haskey(sd,k)`` and ``haskey(smd,k)``
  respectively.  To force the use of ``isequal``
  test on the keys rather than the order object (thus
  slowing the execution from logarithmic to linear time), replace
  the above five constructs with these::

       (k=>v) in collect(sd)
       (k=>v) in collect(smd)
       k in collect(ss)
       k in collect(keys(sd))
       k in collect(keys(smd))


``eltype(sc)``
  Returns the (key,value) type (a 2-entry pair, i.e., ``Pair{K,V}``)
  for SortedDict and SortedMultiDict.
  Returns the key type for SortedSet.  This function may
  also be applied to the type itself.
  Time: O(1)

``keytype(sc)``
  Returns the key type
  for SortedDict, SortedMultiDict and SortedSet.
  This function may
  also be applied to the type itself.
  Time: O(1)


``valtype(sc)``
  Returns the value type
  for SortedDict and SortedMultiDict.
  This function may
  also be applied to the type itself.
  Time: O(1)



``similar(sc)``
  Returns a new SortedDict, SortedMultiDict, or SortedSet
  of the same type and with the same ordering
  as ``sc`` but with no entries (i.e., empty).  Time: O(1)

``orderobject(sc)``
  Returns the order object used to construct the container.  Time: O(1)

``haskey(sc,k)``
  Returns true if key ``k`` is present for SortedDict, SortedMultiDict
  or SortedSet ``sc``.  For SortedSet, ``haskey(sc,k)`` is
  a synonym for ``in(k,sc)``.  For SortedDict and SortedMultiDict,
  ``haskey(sc,k)`` is equivalent to ``in(k,keys(sc))``.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)


``get(sd,k,v)``
  Returns the value associated with key ``k`` where ``sd`` is a SortedDict,
  or else returns ``v`` if ``k`` is not in ``sd``.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)

``get!(sd,k,v)``
  Returns the value associated with key ``k`` where ``sd`` is a SortedDict,
  or else returns ``v`` if ``k`` is not in ``sd``, and in the latter case,
  inserts ``(k,v)`` into ``sd``.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)

``getkey(sd,k,defaultk)``
  Returns key ``k`` where ``sd`` is a SortedDict, if ``k`` is in ``sd``
  else it returns ``defaultk``.
  If the container uses in its ordering
  an ``eq`` method different from
  isequal (e.g., case-insensitive ASCII strings illustrated below), then the
  return value is the actual key stored in the SortedDict that is equivalent
  to ``k`` according to the ``eq`` method, which might not be equal to ``k``.
  Similarly, if the user performs an implicit conversion as part of the
  call (e.g., the container has keys that are floats, but the ``k`` argument
  to ``getkey`` is an Int), then the returned key is the actual stored
  key rather than ``k``.
  Time: O(*c* log *n*)


``isequal(sc1,sc2)``
  Checks if two containers are equal in the sense
  that they contain the same items; the keys are compared
  using the ``eq`` method, while the values are compared with
  the ``isequal`` function.   In the case of SortedMultiDict,
  equality requires that the values associated with a particular
  key have same order (that is, the same insertion order).
  Note that ``isequal`` in this sense
  does not imply any correspondence between semitokens for items
  in ``sc1`` with those for ``sc2``.  If the equality-testing method associated
  with the keys and values implies hash-equivalence in the
  case of SortedDict, then ``isequal`` of the
  entire containers implies hash-equivalence of the containers.
  Time: O(*cn* + *n* log *n*)

``packcopy(sc)``
  This returns a copy of ``sc`` in which the data is
  packed.  When deletions take
  place, the previously allocated memory is not returned.
  This function can be used to reclaim memory after
  many deletions.
  Time: O(*cn* log *n*)

``deepcopy(sc)``
  This returns a copy of ``sc`` in which the data is
  deep-copied, i.e., the keys and values are replicated
  if they are mutable types.  A semitoken for the original ``sc``
  is a valid
  semitoken for the copy because this operation preserves the
  relative positions of the data in memory.
  Time O(*maxn*), where *maxn* denotes the maximum size
  that ``sc`` has attained in the past.

``packdeepcopy(sc)``
  This returns a packed copy of ``sc`` in which the keys
  and values are deep-copied.
  This function can be used to reclaim memory after
  many deletions.
  Time: O(*cn* log *n*)


``merge(sc1, sc2...)``
  This returns a SortedDict or SortedMultiDict that results from merging
  SortedDicts or SortedMultiDicts ``sc1``, ``sc2``, etc., which all must have the same
  key-value-ordering types.  In the case of keys duplicated among
  the arguments, the rightmost argument that owns the
  key gets its value stored for SortedDict. In the case of SortedMultiDict
  all the key-value pairs are stored, and for  keys shared between ``sc1`` and ``sc2`` the
  ordering is left-to-right.  This function is not available for SortedSet,
  but the ``union`` function (see below) provides equivalent functionality.
  Time:  O(*cN* log *N*), where *N* is the total size
  of all the arguments.

``merge!(sc, sc1...)``
  This updates ``sc`` by merging
  SortedDicts or SortedMultiDicts ``sc1``, etc. into ``sc``.
  These must all must have the same
  key-value types.  In the case of keys duplicated among
  the arguments, the rightmost argument that owns the
  key gets its value stored for SortedDict.
  In the case of SortedMultiDict
  all the key-value pairs are stored, and for overlapping keys the
  ordering is left-to-right.  This function is not available for SortedSet,
  but the ``union!`` function (see below) provides equivalent functionality.
  Time:  O(*cN* log *N*), where *N* is the total size
  of all the arguments.

----------------------
Set operations
----------------------

The SortedSet container supports the following set operations.  Note that
in the case of intersect, symdiff and setdiff, the two SortedSets should
have the same key and ordering object.  If they have different key or ordering
types, no error
message is produced; instead, the built-in default versions of these functions
(that can be applied to ``Any`` iterables and that return arrays) are invoked.


``union!(ss, iterable)``
  This function inserts each item from the second argument
  (which must iterable) into the SortedSet ``ss``.  The items
  must be convertible to the key-type of ``ss``.
  Time: O(*ci* log *n*) where *i* is the number of items
  in the iterable argument.

``union(ss, iterable...)``
  This function creates a new SortedSet (the return argument) and
  inserts each item from ``ss`` and each item from each iterable argument
  into the returned SortedSet.  Time:  O(*cn* log *n*) where *n* is the
  total number of items in all the arguments.

``intersect(ss, others...)``
  Each argument is a SortedSet with the same key and order type.
  The return variable is a new SortedSet that is the intersection of
  all the sets that are input.  Time: O(*cn* log *n*), where *n* is the
  total number of items in all the arguments.

``symdiff(ss1, ss2)``
  The two argument are sorted sets with the same key and order type.  This operation
  computes the symmetric difference, i.e., a sorted set containing
  entries that are in one of
  ``ss1``, ``ss2`` but not both.
  Time: O(*cn* log *n*), where *n* is the
  total size of the two containers.

``setdiff(ss1, ss2)``
  The two arguments are sorted sets with the same key and order type.  This operation
  computes the difference, i.e., a sorted set containing entries that in
  are in ``ss1`` but not ``ss2``.
  Time: O(*cn* log *n*), where *n* is the
  total size of the two containers.

``setdiff!(ss, iterable)``
  This function deletes items in ``ss`` that appear in the second argument.
  The second argument must be iterable and its entries must be
  convertible to the key type of m1.
  Time: O(*cm* log *n*), where *n* is the size of ``ss`` and *m* is
  the number of items in ``iterable``.

``issubset(iterable, ss)``
  This function checks whether each item of the first argument
  is an element of the SortedSet ``ss``.  The entries must be
  convertible to the key-type of ``ss``.  Time: O(*cm* log *n*), where
  *n* is the sizes of ``ss`` and *m* is the number of items in ``iterable``.


----------------------
Ordering of keys
----------------------
As mentioned earlier, the default ordering of keys uses
``isless`` and ``isequal`` functions.  If the default ordering is used,
it is a requirement of the container that ``isequal(a,b)`` is true if and
only if ``!isless(a,b)`` and ``!isless(b,a)`` are both true.  This relationship
between ``isequal`` and ``isless`` holds for common built-in types, but
it may not hold for all types, especially user-defined types.
If it does not hold for a certain type, then a custom ordering
argument must be defined as discussed in the next few paragraphs.

The name for the default ordering (i.e., using ``isless`` and
``isequal``) is ``Forward``.  Note: this is the name of the
ordering object; its type is ``ForwardOrdering.``
Another possible
ordering object is ``Reverse``, which reverses the usual sorted order.
This name must be
imported ``import Base.Reverse`` if it is used.

As an example of a custom ordering, suppose the keys
are of type ``ASCIIString``, and the user wishes to order the keys ignoring
case: *APPLE*, *berry* and *Cherry* would appear in that
order, and *APPLE* and *aPPlE* would be indistinguishable in this
ordering.

The simplest approach is to define an ordering object
of the form ``Lt(my_isless)``, where ``Lt`` is a built-in type
(see ``ordering.jl``) and ``my_isless`` is the user's comparison function.
In the above example, the ordering object would be::

     Lt((x,y) -> isless(lowercase(x),lowercase(y)))

The ordering object is indicated in the above list of constructors
in the ``o`` position
(see above for constructor syntax).

This approach suffers from a performance hit (10%-50% depending on the
container) because the compiler cannot inline or compute the
correct dispatch for the function in parentheses, so the dispatch
takes place at run-time.
A more complicated but higher-performance method to implement
a custom ordering is as follows.
First, the user creates a singleton type that is a subtype of
``Ordering`` as follows::

    immutable CaseInsensitive <: Ordering
    end

Next, the user defines a method named ``lt`` for less-than
in this ordering::

    lt(::CaseInsensitive, a, b) = isless(lowercase(a), lowercase(b))

The first argument to ``lt`` is an object of the ``CaseInsensitive``
type (there is only one such object since it is a singleton type).
The container also needs an equal-to function; the default is::

    eq(o::Ordering, a, b) = !lt(o, a, b) && !lt(o, b, a)

For a further slight performance boost, the user can also customize
this function with a more efficient
implementation.  In the above example, an appropriate customization would
be::

    eq(::CaseInsensitive, a, b) = isequal(lowercase(a), lowercase(b))

Finally, the user specifies the unique element of ``CaseInsensitive``, namely
the object ``CaseInsensitive()``, as the ordering object to the
``SortedDict``, ``SortedMultiDict`` or ``SortedSet`` constructor.

For the above code to work, the module must make the following declarations,
typically near the beginning::

    import Base.Ordering
    import Base.lt
    import DataStructures.eq

--------------------------------
Cautionary note on mutable keys
--------------------------------
As with ordinary Dicts, keys for the sorted containers
can be either mutable or immutable.  In the
case of mutable keys, it is important that the keys not be mutated
once they are in the container else the indexing structure will be
corrupted. (The same restriction applies to Dict.)
For example, suppose a SortedDict ``sd`` is defined in which the
keys are of type ``Array{Int,1}.``  (For this to be possible, the user
must provide an ``isless`` function or order object for ``Array{Int,1}`` since
none is built into Julia.)  Suppose the values of ``sd`` are of type ``Int``.
Then the following sequence of statements leaves ``sd`` in
a corrupted state::

   k = [1,2,3]
   sd[k] = 19
   k[1] = 7


-----------------------------------
Performance of Sorted Containers
-----------------------------------

The sorted containers are currently not optimized for cache performance.
This will be addressed in the future.

There is a minor performance issue as follows:
the container may hold onto a small number of keys and values even after the
data records containing those keys and values have been deleted.  This
may cause a memory drain in the case of large keys and values.
It may also lead to a
delay
in the invocation of finalizers.
All keys and values are released completely by the ``empty!`` function.
